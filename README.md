An interactive web application that visualizes the proposed software architecture for the VerseFlow music platform. This tool provides a comprehensive overview of the technology stack, architectural patterns, and design decisions that power a modern music streaming and collaboration platform.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Architecture Visualization**: Explore different components of the VerseFlow architecture
- **Technology Deep Dives**: Learn about the paradigms and technologies behind each component
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses Vite for fast development and optimal production builds

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The VerseFlow platform architecture includes:

- **Frontend Suite**: React/TypeScript web app and Flutter mobile applications
- **Backend Microservices**: Go, Rust, Elixir, Python, and Kotlin services
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud-native solutions
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and deployment

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
